<h2 align="center">History of Changes in Version 1.x</h2>
<h3>Version 1.9.1 (17/Oct/2002)</h3>
<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Version number now resides in iup.h (it is also included in the library during 
  compilation.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>IupLabel with \n was not working.</li>
  <li>Line-break in attribute IUP_TIP is now accepted.</li>
  <li>Double-click in the Windows top-left corner made the program crash.</li>
  <li>IUP_READONLY was only accepted if used before IupMap 
  in a IupText or IupMultiline.</li>
  <li>Windows was limiting initial elements of a IupList to 999.</li>
  <li>New attribute FULLSCREEN created.</li>
  <li>The codes of the numeric keyboard when the CapsLock was turned on were not mapped correctly to IUP.</li>
  <li>New callback added MENUSELECT_CB (called when the mouse hovers over a menu or 
  item.) - not fully implemented.</li>
  <li>Fixed IupList ACTION callback calls for pre-selected items on the first selection change.</li>

  fonts.</li>
  <li>It is acceptable now to select an option in a popup menu with any mouse key.</li>
  <li>Attribute IUP_STATUS in a filedlg was not working in a silicon.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupLua</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Better error messages.</li>
  <li>In the iuptree control, the callback BRANCHOPEN_CB 
  was not passing the node parameter.</li>
  <li>In the iuptree control, new functions were implemented to associate and retrieve a 
  Lua Table from a node or leaf.</li>
  <li>IupGLCanvas binding.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupTree</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Expand and collapse no more alters selection of elements.</li>

  inside a tree_selection callback, the program crashed.</li>
  <li>BRANCH_OPEN now passes parameter node.</li>
  <li>IUP_DEPTH now works for folders and leaves. Attention: the depth works only with 
  the appointed element, not with its children.</li>
  <li>Some conditions necessary for a DEPTH change were wrong.</li>
  <li>Redraw optimization.</li>
  <li>When a tree was big, the scrollback was not working properly.</li>
  <li>When the tree was totally expanded and the scrollbar was all down, collapsing folders made the thumb be wrongly 
  calculated.</li>
  <li>PGDN and PGUP were stopping in any folder that was 
  closed.</li>
  <li>Even when the user did not want a folder or leaf to be selected, sometimes the tree allowed it.</li>
  <li>When the tree's folder does not have children, an empty box is shown next to it (instead of the + and - symbol.)</li>

<ul>
  <li>The attributes IUP_DEFAULTESC and IUP_DEFAULTENTER 
  of a dialog were not working in Windows (they work only when the matrix is not in edition mode.)</li>
  <li>The matrix did not show the selected elements when the focus passed to another interface element.</li>
  <li>In a dropdown, when the user left edition mode changing the focus away from the matrix, the previously entered 
  value was lost.</li>
  <li>Selection with the control key now works for selecting and deselecting.</li>
  <li>The cell with the input focus now draws the selection status.</li>
  <li>The attribute IUP_MARKED now works after the matrix is mapped.</li>
  <li>The matrix now starts with no cell selected.</li>
  <li>Clicking on the first column of a marked line with MARK_MODE LIN now also 
  deselects the line.</li>
  <li>When MARK_MODE is LIN, 
  COL or LINCOL the selection is not done on the focused cell.</li>
  <li>When MARK_MODE is CELL and
  MULTIPLE is NO the whole line cannot be marked.</li>
  <li>When MARK_MODE is NO nothing can be selected.</li>
  <li>The [TAB] key in the matrix now changes focus to next element.</li>

<h3>Version 1.9.0 (18 Dec 2001)</h3>
<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The K_ANY callback now considers the state of the CAPSLOCK key. The native 
  behavior of the combination of the keys CAPSLOCK and SHIFT was kept. </li>
  <li>New binding for IUP: Lua 4.0.</li>
  <li>New binding for IupMask.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Windows</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Driver Windows now deals only with messages generated for IUP elements (this used to be a problem with CD's print 
  dialog). </li>
  <li>Label fonts did not work when set before IupMap. </li>
  <li>Attribute IUP_FILTERUSED now can be set on before the creation of
  IupFileDlg.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Tip in Windows now accepts \n. </li>
  <li>Tip in Windows is now modified immediatly after it is set though programming. </li>
  <li>Tip now can be removed immediatly. </li>
  <li>In a SubMenu, the attribute ACTIVE was not working 
  propertly. </li>
  <li>The OPEN_CB callback was implemented in the SubMenu.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Motif&nbsp;</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Callback OPEN_CB in a SubMenu was providing wrong 
  parameter. </li>
  <li>Attribute&nbsp; IUP_BORDER in a dialog was working differently from the manual 
  when the window manager was sawfish.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>iupMask</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>iupMask was becoming unstable when the user set the attribute
  IUP_SELECTION in a IupText. </li>
  <li>There was a bug in the IupMask-IupMatrix 
  combination. </li>
</ul>
<h4><b>IupMatrx</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Adding a new column or line is now correctly dealing with color inheritance.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>There was IUP_MARK_MODE defined but not: IUP_LIN,
  IUP_COL, IUP_LINCOL and 
  IUP_CELL. </li>
  <li>The drop_cb callback was being called for any focus change. It is now being called 
  just when the matrix enters edition mode. </li>
  <li>The matrix was not showing the selected cells when the user changed focus from the matrix. </li>
  <li>The matrix was not calling K_ANY from the parent if the callback had been set 
  after matrix creation. </li>
  <li>IUP_RIGHTCLICK_CB is now called IUP_CLICK_CB. This 
  callback is now called for every mouse button. </li>
  <li>New callback IUP_MOUSEMOVE_CB. </li>
</ul>
<h4><b>IupTree</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Attribute IUP_MARKED now also sets. </li>
  <li>IupTree's binding now exports functions to set and get ID. </li>
  <li>Redraw is now done with one attribute. This avoids unecessary redraw when the user 
  wants to insert a lot of data.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>IupTree now takes leafs and nodes before IupMap.
  </li>
  <li>Clicking to select a&nbsp; LEAF was not always working in Windows. </li>
  <li>BRANCHOPEN and BRANCHCLOSE callbacks were not 
  testing the return value correctly. </li>
  <li>Double clicking was not working propertly. When the user clicked a node, while the timer was still waiting for the 
  second click, it was impossible to click a nother node. </li>
  <li>Hitting the space button with CTRL pressed now marks the element immediatly. </li>
  <li>SELECTION_CB callback was created. This callback is called when any type of mark 
  is made on the Tree. The return value blocks this action. </li>
  <li>Removed callbacks BEFORESELECTION_CB and 
  AFTERSELECTION_CB.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Setting IUP_VALUE though programming does not activate callbacks anymore. </li>
  <li>Keyboard control, including arrow keys, PGUP, PGDOWN, HOME e END were not working propertly. </li>
  <li>Clicking + or - was not activating the SELECTION_CB callback. </li>
  <li>SELECTION_CB is now in the binding. BEFORESELECTION_CB 
  and AFTERSELECTION_CB are not. </li>
  <li>The IUP_MARKEDid attribute now returns IUP_YES or
  IUP_NO depending on the state of the node's mark. If the node does not exist, the 
  returned value is NULL. </li>
  <li>IupTree was breaking when it tried to erase a marked node inside
  BRANCHCLOSE_CB. </li>
  <li>The BRANCHCLOSE_CB callback was not being called for the correct node. </li>
  <li>SELECTION_CB was included in the binding. </li>
  <li>Including a new leaf now does not alter selection. </li>
</ul>
<h4><b>IupGL</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Created attribute &quot;ERROR&quot; indicating error in a GL canvas. </li>
</ul>
<h4><b>IupCB</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>User canvas was not being reactivated after the mouse callbacks. </li>
</ul>
<h4><b>IupLua</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>IupGetGlobal and IupSetGlobal were not doing 
  toupper. </li>
  <li>New function created to get an Ihandle created in C: 
  IupGetFromC. </li>
  <li>The IUP_BUTTON_CB callback was not being called. </li>
  <li>Functions isshift, iscontrol,
  isbutton1, isbutton2, 
  isbutton3 and isdouble are now exported. </li>
  <li>IupPreviousField and IupNextField were not 
  implemented. </li>
  <li>The OPEN_CB callback was implemented in the binding with the name
  OPEN. </li>
  <li>New callback IUP_MOUSEMOVE_CB for matrix.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.9 (07 May 2001)</h3>
<h4>IupMatrx Control&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the user defined FGCOLOR while the matrix was 
  in edition mode, the application crashed.</li>
  <li>Hitting Esc was causing garbage to be written in the matrix field.</li>
  <li>A bug that made the value_edit callback be called several times was fixed (it was 
  called several times because the matrix kept trying to exit the edition mode with other events).</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupTree Control&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>New IupTree control.</li>
  <li>Scrollbar.</li>
  <li>Multiple selection.</li>
  <li>Default image size: 16x16.</li>
  <li>Lua Binding.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupCB Control&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the Lua colorbrowser element has changed. Now it is called
  iupcb, not cb.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The IUP_MULTIPLEFILES attribute was created. Now it is possible, in Windows, to 
  select several files in a FileDlg.</li>
  <li>IupHelp now only initializes DDE when it is used.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.8 (15 Mar 2001)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The global.h, macros.h, rgb.h and hls.h files are no longer exported by IUP.</li>
  <li>
  Some keys were in conflict among themselves 
  (shift-home and 4, for instance). Shift-space and Ctrl-space were added to the K_ANY callback (Windows and Motif).</li>
  <li>
  IUP_VISIBLE was returning NULL on IUP when the dialog was not mapped.</li>
  <li>
  IupSetLanguage can now be called before IupOpen();</li>
  <li>
  iuptoolbar and iupfiletext were removed from the distribution.</li>
</ul>
<h4>CPI</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Several defines (such as strieq) are no longer exported from iupcpi.h</li>
  <li>
  Functions iupAddSymbol, iupGetSymbol, iupgetdata and iupsetdata are no longer exported from the CPI.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Motif&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The Tip font is now inherited from the element it belongs.</li>
  <li>
  Inserting a text (IUP_INSERT or IUP_APPEND) on Motif was ignoring the maximum number of characters.</li>
  <li>
  Some ITALIC fonts were not working.</li>
  <li>
  Several visibility problems were fixed for
  ZBOX inside a ZBOX.</li>
  <li>
  The default value of the ALLOWNEW attribute (in fileopen mode) allowed creating a new file (now standardized).</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupTabs Control&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  IupTabs was not considering attribute IUP_ALIGNMENT.</li>
  <li>
  Tabs was not showing the selected element if it was selected while the Tabs was invisible (it was a Motif bug).</li>
  <li>
  The &lt;TAB&gt; key was neither passing the focus 
  to IupTabs nor taking the focus off it.</li>
  <li>
  The SIZE attribute is now defined for the tabs of IupTabs  ICTL_TABSIZE.</li>
  <li>
  Changing the text value for Tabs was not recomputing the Tabs size.</li>
  <li>
  The appearance of IupTabs was enhanced.</li>
  <li>
  IupTabs now sends the focus back to the first element when the user tries to shift right after 
  the last element.</li>
  <li>
  Now a redraw can be forced on Tabs with the IUP_REDRAW attribute.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupMatrx Control&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Ctrl+arrows was not working properly.</li>
  <li>
  The behavior of the DEL key to delete a set 
  of cells now also considers the return of the IUP_EDITION_CB callback.</li>
  <li>
  The mark is now shown (not the focus) when
  matrx loses the focus (users were having problems 
  when wishing to hit a button to cause an action over the matrix).</li>
  <li>
  Oh the NT platform, the fields of the 
  created matrix had the wrong values when an automatic scroll occurred.</li>
  <li>
  Right-clicking the matrix now passes the 
  control parameter (as in BUTTON_CB) isshift(r), iscontrol(r), isbutton1(r), 
  isbutton2(r), isbutton3(r), isdouble(r)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  Vertically scrolling by dragging the thumb 
  now works properly.</li>
  <li>
  The focus is now correctly drawn inside the 
  matrix (when only half the cell appears, half of the focus is drawn).</li>
  <li>
  When leaving the edition mode by clicking an 
  element outside the matrix, the focus was remaining on the IupText in the matrix.</li>
  <li>
  Colors and alignments are now moved when a 
  cell is moved either by adding new lines or columns or by deleting lines or columns.</li>
  <li>
  The matrix now leaves the edition mode 
  whenever lines or columns are removed.</li>
  <li>
  When the user clicked a cell near the end of 
  the matrix (on the x coordinate) an automatic scroll was made and the cell beside the desired cell was marked.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  KEY in IupItem was replicating the underlined KEYs (and some times adding the wrong values because of that).</li>
</ul>
<h4>IupLua.exe</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Now works properly with all controls.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IUP Manual&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  All elements now have examples at least in 
  IupLua and C.</li>
  <li>
  The IupMask manual was created.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.7 (23 Nov 2000)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The alignment of composition elements can 
  now be changed on-the-fly. </li>
  <li>
  Current language treatment has been changed. 
  ATTENTION: previous 
  putenv no longer works! Use new functions 
  IupSetLanguage and 
  IupGetLanguage. Default language: Portuguese. </li>
  <li>
  IupAlarm's design was reformulated. Now all buttons 
  have the same size. </li>
  <li>
  Functions 
  IupUnMapFont and 
  IupMapFont were created to make the use of the 
  drivers fonts easier. </li>
  <li>
  Attribute 
  IUP_FONT now accepts a string either with the native 
  font or the IUP font, and always returns the native font (attributes 
  WINFONT and 
  MOTFONT are now obsolete). </li>
</ul>
<h4>Motif&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Motif did not have 
  K_ANY for 
  IupList in dropdown mode. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_VISIBLE attribute now works for 
  FRAME, ZBOX, VBOX, HBOX and 
  RADIO (all elements were tested). Now it is no 
  longer lost for internal 
  HBOX elements when the 
  HBOX visibility is changed. </li>
  <li>
  When the user changed from one 
  ZBOX to another, the first one was forgetting 
  which elements were visible. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  When 
  Toggle 1 (default) begins deactivated, it no longer 
  remains marked forever. </li>
  <li>
  Toggle with image now accepts images 
  IUP_IMPRESS and 
  IUP_IMINACTIVE, but it follows the Windows standard for 
  Toggle manipulation. </li>
  <li>
  Toggle was not verifying whether it was active or 
  not when it was created. </li>
  <li>
  Canvas redraw was optimized. The canvas now 
  uses transparent color as default. The user is in charge of drawing the canvas, but now it no longer blinks when a 
  redraw is made. Tip: To avoid unnecessary canvas redraws, do not put it inside a frame and use the 
  IUP_CLIPCHILDREN attribute. </li>
  <li>
  Initializing 
  Toggle (or 
  Radio) with a value and then modifying it via 
  callback was marking both toggles. </li>
  <li>
  Changing 
  Toggles color (IUP_FGCOLOR) was not working on Windows unless its 
  background color was also changed. </li>
  <li>
  IupItem outside a submenu was not calling the 
  callback. </li>
  <li>
  On Windows, the 
  IUP_HOTSPOT attribute was being read incorrectly (the 
  correct form is with ":"). </li>
</ul>
<h4>IupMatrix Control&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  DROPDOWNs function in Matrix was corrected. Now the 
  user fulfills the dropdown values, which always start at position 1. If the user wishes, he/she can set the initial 
  dropdown value by checking the 
  IUP_PREVIOUSVALUE attribute about the dropdown element passed 
  as parameter. This attribute returns the previously selected string value. </li>
  <li>
  Dropdown now enters edition mode just as regular 
  fields do. </li>
  <li>
  Dropdown can automatically close after the users 
  choice. Simply return 
  IUP_CONTINUE for the callback chosen by the dropdown.
  </li>
  <li>
  Now the dropdown accepts the ESC key, 
  restoring its previous value. </li>
  <li>
  An element with focus is now drawn with 
  double focus. </li>
  <li>
  The color of a selected element is now 20% 
  attenuated. </li>
  <li>
  When the user entered edition mode using the 
  mouse and exited it hitting ENTER, the cell remained selected. </li>
  <li>
  Matrix no longer gets lost when it has 0 
  lines. </li>
  <li>
  Matrix was not accepting a user to return a 
  constant string with \n from a callback. </li>
  <li>
  A Matrix that loses the focus does not lose 
  the selection (but it is not apparent). </li>
  <li>
  TAB no longer changes cells in the Matrix 
  (it now changes IUP elements). </li>
  <li>
  Hitting delete on a marked element deletes 
  everything. </li>
  <li>
  Matrix leaves the edition mode when 
  IupTexts exit arrows are used. </li>
  <li>
  There was a computation mistake in cell size 
  when the Matrix was in edition mode. </li>
  <li>
  When the user scrolls, the Matrix exits the 
  edition mode. </li>
  <li>
  ALL problems caused by 
  cdActivate in Matrix were solved. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Extended Controls</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The element from IupGL was not getting the 
  focus when it was the only element in the dialog. </li>
  <li>
  In IupGL, OpenGL now synchronizes its 
  functioning with Motif (glXWaitX) at resize. </li>
  <li>
  IupGC now works with 
  IUP_ENGLISHs variable set (cancel/cancela, 
  red/Verm, etc.) </li>
  <li>
  IupGauge now accepts changing text or percentage 
  values on-the-fly. </li>
  <li>
  Tabs font now has a differentiated color 
  when it is inactive. </li>
</ul>
<h4>IupLua</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  IupScanf at IupLua was not performing the final 
  dialogs popup. </li>
  <li>
  IupSetLanguage, IupGetLanguage, IupMapFont and 
  IupUnMapFont were created at IupLua. </li>
  <li>
  It now considers the 
  IUPLUA_QUIET attribute. </li>
  <li>
  The callbacks in IupLua are now inherited 
  (eg.: 
  k_any from a dialog is called when 
  IupCanvas does not have 
  k_any). </li>
  <li>
  The librarys opening message now follows a 
  standard. </li>
  <li>
  IupLua was passing Luas pointer to IUP 
  instead of copying its value in 
  IupSetHandle (making it crash). </li>
</ul>
<h4>IupLua Program</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  iuplua was not running with 
  IupVal and 
  IupGetColor. </li>
  <li>
  iuplua now accepts several files as a parameter.
  </li>
  <li>
  iuplua is now joined with 
  iupluafull </li>
  <li>
  iuplua now shows line number and cursor column.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.6 (21 Jun 2000)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  All libraries were generated for AIX 4.3.2, 
  which is available in new IBM machines. </li>
  <li>
  A series of memory management problems was 
  solved for all platforms. </li>
  <li>
  Attribute 
  IUP_SELECTEDTEXT now can also be used to change the selected 
  text in a 
  IupText and 
  IupMultiline field. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IupLabel element now takes the 
  IUP_ALIGNMENT attribute into account. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IupList (dropdown) element now always leaves some 
  option selected (unless there is none to select). </li>
  <li>
  When the selected elements value in 
  IupList (dropdown) is changed, it now remains 
  selected with the new value. </li>
</ul>
<h4>User Manual</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The user manual is now also available in 
  several Windows Help formats, including the help format for Visual C++ (5 and 6). To configure your account for Visual 
  C++ to access IUPs Help, run 
  W:\iup\help\iuphelp.reg (ATTENTION: On Visual Studio, IUPs manual 
  must be activated and deactivated through option Help -&gt; Use extension Help). Other available formats can be found 
  at 
  W:\iup\Help. </li>
  <li>
  A general revision of the user manual is 
  being made. </li>
  <li>
  The CPI manual was rewritten. </li>
  <li>
  Several examples were included. </li>
  <li>
  An application called iupluatest (W:\iup\bin) was created to run the IupLua examples 
  included in the manual (it works with the controls using the installed DLLs). </li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  There is no longer any restriction for the 
  number of dialogs created using IUP (the only limitation now is Windows capacity to create native elements).
  </li>
  <li>
  Events of 
  IupButton and 
  IupToggle were being improperly called when a 
  IupHide or a 
  IupShow was made on the dialog. </li>
  <li>
  A bug when drawing an image associated to a
  IupToggle element was fixed. </li>
  <li>
  The functioning of attributes 
  IUP_DEFAULTENTER and 
  IUP_DEFAULTESC was corrected. </li>
  <li>
  Now, when a user changes the selection of a 
  multiple 
  IupList via programming, IUP internally updates the 
  selection. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_BGCOLOR attribute to define a new cursor was not 
  standardized with the Motif, and color 0 in the Windows image was never allowed to be transparent. </li>
  <li>
  A bug in the dropdown list was fixed. It was 
  not calling callback 
  GETFOCUS_CB, causing instability in the 
  IupMatrix element). </li>
  <li>
  The transparency color in a cursor now must 
  be color number 0 (according to the manual, this is the way it was supposed to be). </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IupList (dropdown) callback is no longer called for 
  element 0 (which does not exist). </li>
  <li>
  A button in a 
  Popup dialog was only allowing to be pressed via 
  mouse. Now it can be pressed with the space key. </li>
  <li>
  The IupSetAttribute(x,IUP_VISIBLE,IUP_YES) call, when 
  x was a dialog, was not working. </li>
  <li>
  Calling 
  IupHide with a frame, with 
  [hvz]box or with 
  radio was not the same thing as calling IupSetAttribute(n,IUP_VISIBLE,IUP_NO)&quot;.
  </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_MOUSEPOS position in a dialogs 
  IupPopup was not functioning. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Motif&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Several memory leaks were fixed. They 
  occurred when 
  IupGetAttribute called functions from XM which allocated 
  memory to store the attributes value. This change may cause problems for applications which did not copy the value 
  returned from 
  IupGetAttribute and used the returned string. This usage of 
  the return value from 
  IupGetAttribute is not appropriate, because the user has to 
  copy this string if he/she intends to remain using it (the returned string is intern to IUP). </li>
  <li>
  The dialog's 
  Close callback was not closing the application 
  when it returned 
  IUP_CLOSE. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_ACTION callback from 
  IupMultiline was not returning the new text value if the 
  key was validated (parameter<i> </i>after). </li>
  <li>
  The dropdown list was not automatically 
  showing the first element when it was opened. </li>
  <li>
  The Motif now returns the default 
  font when IupGetAttribute(n,IUP_FONT) is performed. </li>
</ul>
<h4>IupLua</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The names of callbacks 
  show_cb and 
  map_cb were corrected. </li>
  <li>
  A bug that made a toggle image not appear 
  was fixed. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Extended Controls</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The default cursor of the 
  IupMatrix element now looks like the MS Excel cursor. 
  (Remember to call 
  IupMatrixOpen() even when using IupLua!) </li>
  <li>
  Alignment (center) of the field in column 0 
  of the IupMatrix element. </li>
  <li>
  The user can now return 
  IUP_CONTINUE at the action callback of element 
  IupMatrix to allow IUP to go on treating pressed keys 
  in the conventional IUP way. </li>
  <li>
  The dropdown list at 
  IupMatrix was losing its current value when the user 
  changed cells. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IupGetColor element was being drawn outside the canvas 
  (old problem in 
  cdActivate). </li>
  <li>
  The font in 
  IupTabs is now inherited. </li>
  <li>
  Attributes 
  ICTL_ACTIVE_FONT, ICTL_INACTIVE_FONT, ICTL_FONT were implemented in the 
  IupTabs element. </li>
  <li>
  Attribute 
  IUP_MARGIN was implemented for the 
  IupGauge element. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.5 (18 Apr 2000)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The versions of libraries IUP and IupLua 
  were synchronized. From this version on, these tools will be distributed together. </li>
  <li>
  The library generation mechanism was changed 
  to use libmake. All DLLs are available and following the same standard as the DLLs of other Tecgraf libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
  A FAQ was created for IUP:
  <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~mark/iup/faq-iup.txt">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~mark/iup/faq-iup.txt</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  Several memory management problems were 
  fixed. </li>
  <li>
  Attribute 
  IUP_DIALOGTYPE can now assume three values: 
  IUP_OPEN, IUP_SAVE and 
  IUP_DIR. Due to the creation of 
  IUP_DIR, the 
  IUP_ALLOWDIR attribute is no longer used. </li>
  <li>
  One more value was added to attribute 
  BGCOLOR: IUP_TRANSPARENT (used only by the Canvas to avoid 
  unnecessary drawing). </li>
  <li>
  Function 
  IupGetError was removed from 
  iup.h. </li>
  <li>
  Function 
  IupDataEntry was removed from 
  iup.h. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Function 
  iupdrvSetIdleFunction was added to make the Windows 
  compatible with Motif. </li>
  <li>
  The bug that made IUP crash when using
  MessageBox inside a button callback was fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
  IupDestroy now reconfigures the button control 
  function (it was making IUP crash). </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_READONLY attribute was implemented (valid for 
  Text and 
  Multiline). </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_FILTERUSED attribute was implemented: it informs which 
  is the filter selected by the user (1, 2, 3...). </li>
  <li>
  A bug that caused 
  IupPopup(IupMenu(item)) not to call the items callback was fixed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Motif&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  IupDestroy was corrected. In a 
  IupFrame, it made IUP crash. </li>
  <li>
  IupList was corrected. It crashed when the user 
  changed its elements and tried to set 
  IUP_VALUE. </li>
  <li>
  The memory leak at 
  IupGetFile was removed. </li>
  <li>
  List elements were not being correctly 
  deleted. </li>
</ul>
<h4>IupMatrix Element&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The bug in the NT matrix was fixed. It was 
  not refreshing added elements (the values on the cells were wrong). </li>
  <li>
  The bug in the scroll matrix was fixed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.4 (09 Dec 1999)</h3>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>

  A problem, which called the dropdown 
  callback even for an already-deleted element, was fixed.</li>
  <li>
  Function 
  IupHelp is now available.</li>
  <li>
  A bug was fixed; it caused excessive system 
  resource usage when dialogs with several elements were used.</li>
  <li>
  The size of the version dialog was corrected.</li>
  <li>
  A bug was fixed; it made IUP crash depending 
  on the use of 
  MessageBox. Same for 
  IupFileDialog.</li>
  <li>
  Callback 
  IUP_BUTTON_CB was added for the 
  IupButton element.</li>
  <li>
  A bug was fixed; it made 
  IupGetInt(d,IUP_X) return a wrong value when the dialog was 
  maximized.</li>
</ul>
<h4>CPI Controls&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The color inheritance problem was fixed.</li>
  <li>
  Corrections were made to the 
  Dial size.</li>
  <li>
  Attributes of colors 
  FGCOLOR, BGCOLOR, and fonts 
  FONT, WINFONT, MOTIFFONT.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.3 (15 Jun 1999)</h3>
<h4>Windows&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_ACTIVE attribute now also works in the frame.</li>
  <li>
  The 
  action callback in 
  Multiline now also accepts the DEL key.</li>
  <li>
  Toggle element now accepts an image.</li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_TOOLBOX attribute was implemented for dialogs.</li>
  <li>
  A bug was removed; it made a second 
  IupShow in a dialog reset its position to the 
  center of the screen.</li>
  <li>
  Treatment of the 
  SIZE and 
  RASTERSIZE attributes was changed.</li>
  <li>
  The 
  IUP_ACTION callback now treats the DEL key and 
  commands and keys from the Cut and Paste menu.</li>
  <li>
  A conflict was solved; it made the key
  - generate a call to the callback as if it 
  were key 
   (plic).</li>
  <li>
  Keyboard accelerators for menus now work, 
  since the focus is no longer on the dialog. When a dialog receives the focus back, it sets the focus to the last 
  control inside it that had the focus.</li>
  <li>
  IUP_K_ANY no longer issues beeps when keys are 
  pressed on the canvas.</li>
  <li>
  When the 
  IUP_STARTFOCUS attribute is not defined, the focus is set 
  for the first control in the dialog that accepts it, thus preventing the dialog from keeping the focus and allowing 
  the menus to be called via accelerator.</li>
  <li>
  Attribute 
  IUP_SELECTION was implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Motif&nbsp;</h4>
<ul TYPE="disc">
  <li>
  Color management for 8bpp displays (256 
  colors) was re-implemented. Basic colors used by IUP (black, white and the grays used for highlight and shadow) are 
  now reserved, and the search for colors in the palette was optimized. </li>
  <li>
  Elements such as 
  IupCanvas now have their own visual, independent from 
  their parents. If allowed by the display, the default visual of a canvas will be TrueColor (24bpp); if not, it will 
  be the same as the default display visual. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  IupToggle element now processes the IMAGE attribute 
  differently: it now shows the toggle with the same appearance as the 
  IupButton element, but maintaining its functionality 
   the button remains pressed until the user clicks it again. The 
  IMPRESS attribute can be used to define the image 
  used for the pressed button. In this case, the user is in charge of giving it a 3D appearance. </li>
  <li>
  IMPORTANT: The size of the dialog can be 
  adjusted after being mapped, by means of the 
  SIZE and 
  RASTERSIZE attributes
  <ul TYPE="square">
    <li>
    The size of the dialog has now precedence 
    over the smallest size required by its children (either having been specified in its creation or in run-time).</li>
    <li>
    Attributing a 
    NULL value to the 
    SIZE or 
    RASTERSIZE (in C) of a dialog will re-compute its size 
    according to the size of its children. </li>
    <li>
    Partial dimensions (###x and 
    x###) are now treated correctly. </li>
    <li>
    Therefore, applications that define sizes 
    for dialogs (either in LED or in C) smaller than the minimum size required by their children will show truncated 
    dialogs. To force a computation based on the size of the children, set any of these attributes to 
    NULL (in C) or simply do not define them in LED. 
    As a general rule, avoid specifying a dialog size unless there is a real need for such  in this case, be careful to 
    specify a sufficient size.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>IupFileDlg:
  <ul TYPE="square">
    <li>
    The default value for the 
    DIALOGTYPE attribute was not being recognized (the 
    program aborted when there was no defined value).</li>
    <li>
    When 
    ALLOWNEW = NO, the dialog informs if the user is 
    specifying a non-existing file (instead of simply returning, as was happening).</li>
    <li>
    When the dialog type was 
    OPEN, the returned value was 
    1 (Cancel) even when the user confirmed the 
    operation. </li>
    <li>
    If 
    DIALOGTYPE is 
    SAVE, a confirmation is required if the file 
    already exists. </li>
    <li>
    A new dialog was created for each popup 
    without destroying the previous dialog. </li>
    <li>
    The 
    NOCHANGEDIR attribute was implemented. </li>
    <li>
    The dialog does not return if the user 
    specifies a new file when attribute 
    ALLOWNEW = NO. The same happens when attribute 
    ALLOWDIR = NO and a directory is specified. In these 
    cases, alerts are shown. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  The 
  iupGetColor function for CPI controls was replaced in 
  functionality by the 
  iupGetRGB function (iupGetColor is maintained for compatibility purposes, 
  but it should no longer be used).</li>
  <li>
  TRUECOLORCANVAS was created. It indicates if the display 
  allows the creation of 
  TrueColor windows (&gt; 8bpp), even if the default is
  PseudoColor. </li>
  <li>
  Tabs: a problem was fixed concerning the use 
  of the 
  VISIBLE attribute for elements belonging to a 
  non-selected tab. </li>
  <li>
  IupHelp: allows using a browser (default = 
  Netscape) for viewing HTML pages. </li>
  <li>
  The 
  ACTION_CB callback, from 
  IupText, now receives, apart from 
  Ihandle* and 
  int, a 
  char* pointing to the new text value in case the 
  key is confirmed. </li>
  <li>
  Dropdown lists were not correctly processing 
  the 
  VISIBLE attribute. </li>
  <li>
  A problem with the initialization of 
  multiple-selection lists was solved: the 
  VALUE attribute was not being respected in some 
  cases. </li>
  <li>
  Attributes 
  FGCOLOR and 
  BGCOLOR from the dropdown list were not being 
  correctly updated. </li>
  <li>
  IupLoopStep was re-implemented: now it no longer blocks 
  when there are no events to be processed (it simply returns 
  DEFAULT).</li>
  <li>
  The dropdown list is closed when the 
  associated textbox is totally or partially darkened. </li>
  <li>
  The dropdown list was not being closed when 
  the dialog lost the focus if 
  IupIdle was registered. </li>
  <li>
  A problem in the exhibition of CPI controls 
  was fixed. </li>
  <li>
  New return code (CONTINUE) was created, specific for key callbacks, 
  to be used when the event is to be propagated to the parent of the element receiving it. </li>
  <li>
  In some situations, elements destroyed by 
  means of 
  IupDestroy were receiving events, making the 
  application abort. </li>
  <li>
  The redefinition of items in the main menu 
  was making the dialog return to its original size. </li>
  <li>
  Consulting attribute 
  BGCOLOR in a dropdown list was aborting the 
  application. </li>
  <li>
  Consulting attributes 
  BGCOLOR and 
  FGCOLOR of a canvas with a different visual from 
  the default was generating an X-Windows error message. </li>
  <li>
  The problem with 
  IupFileDlg was fixed (the application was aborting).</li>
  <li>
  IupDestroy in a bar menu was inducting an infinite 
  loop to the application. </li>
  <li>
  The list now matches the documentation: it 
  calls the action callback for the de-selected element (with the 
  v = 0 parameter).</li>
  <li>
  Bug correction: The use of a Motif attribute 
  instead of a function was making Motif lost control of memory management (memory already liberated was liberated 
  again, which aborted the application).</li>
  <li>
  ACTION in 
  IupText caused 
  SIGSEV when the user pressed ENTER. </li>
  <li>
  New 
  IupMapFont for mapping IUP fonts -&gt; Motif. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.2</h3>
<h4>Windows (12 Jan 99)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Function 
  char* IupMapFont( char* font ) converts a IUP font describer (used by the
  IUP_FONT attribute) into a native font describer 
  (used by 
  IUP_WIN_FONT).</li>
  <li>
  File Drag &amp; Drop was implemented in dialogs 
  and canvases, via the 
  IUP_DROPFILES_CB callback.</li>

  Attribute 
  IUP_EXTFILTER was implemented for the 
  IupFileDlg control, allowing the use of more than one

  as a parameter.</li>
  <li>
  New text callback was implemented; it 
  receives the text both before and after the change, and receives the code of the typed key.</li>
  <li>
  It was possible to set two activated radio 
  toggles by selecting 
  VALUE for one of them on the radio and 
  VALUE = ON on the other toggle.</li>
  <li>
  Attributes

  <li>
  A problem was corrected for the lists, which 
  were being reset between a 
  IupShow/IupPopup and another.</li>
  <li>
  Attribute 
  IUP_SELECTEDTEXT was implemented. It returns the selected 
  text (if there is any), with the \r already filtered.</li>

<h4>Motif v1.8.2 (14 Aug 98)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  IupFileDlg was corrected: the 
  IUP_FILE and 
  IUP_DIR attributes were not being treated correctly.</li>
