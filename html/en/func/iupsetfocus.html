<h2>IupSetFocus</h2>
<p>Sets the interface element that will 
  receive the keyboard focus, i.e., the element that will receive keyboard events. 
But this will be processed only after the control actually receive the focus.</p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>Ihandle *IupSetFocus(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>); [in C]
iup.SetFocus(<strong>ih</strong>: ihandle) -&gt; <strong>ih</strong>: ihandle [in Lua]</pre>
<p><b>ih</b>: identifier of the interface element that will receive the keyboard focus. Only 
  elements that can have the keyboard focus, are mapped, active and visible can be used, other elements are ignored.</p>
<p><span class="style1">Returns:</span> the identifier of the interface 
  element that previously had the keyboard focus.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The value returned by <strong>IupGetFocus</strong> will be updated only after 
the main loop regain the control and the control actually receive the focus. So 
if you call <strong>IupGetFocus</strong> right after <strong>IupSetFocus</strong> 
the return value will be different. You could call <strong>IupFlush</strong> 
between the two functions to obtain the same value in both calls.</p>
