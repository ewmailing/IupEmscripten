<h3><a name="Using">Using</a></h3>
<p>Callbacks are used by the application to receive notifications from the 
system that the user or the system itself has interacted with the user interface 
of the application. On the other hand attributes are used by the application to 
communicate with the user interface system.</p>
<p>Even though callbacks have different purposes from attributes, they are also associated to an 
  element by means of an name. </p>
<p>The OLD method to associate a function to a callback, the application must employ the
  <b>IupSetAttribute</b> 
  function, linking the action to a name (passed as a string). From this point on, this name will refer to a callback. 
  By means of function <b>IupSetFunction</b>, the user connects this name to the callback.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
  For example: </p>
<pre>int myButton_action(Ihandle* self);
...
IupSetAttribute(myButton, &quot;ACTION&quot;, &quot;my_button_action&quot;);
IupSetFunction(&quot;my_button_action&quot;, (Icallback)myButton_action);</pre>
<p>In LED, callback are only assigned by their names. It will be still necessary to associate the name with the 
  corresponding function in C using <b>IupSetFunction</b>. For example:</p>
<pre># In LED, is equivalent to the IupSetAttribute command in the previous example.
bt = button(&quot;Title&quot;, my_button_action)  </pre>
<p>In the NEW method, the application does not needs a global name, it directly sets the callback 
  using the attribute name using <b>IupSetCallback</b>. For example:</p>
<pre>int myButton_action(Ihandle* self);
...
IupSetCallback(myButton, &quot;ACTION&quot;, (Icallback)myButton_action);</pre>
<p>The new method is more efficient and more secure, because there is no risk of a name conflict. If 
  the application uses LED, just ignore the name in the LED, and replace <b>IupSetFunction</b> by 
<b>IupSetCallback</b>.</p>
<p>Although enabled in old versions, callbacks do NOT have
  <b>inheritance</b> like attributes.</p>
<p>All callbacks receive at least the element which activated the action as a parameter (self).<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>The callbacks implemented in C by the application must return one of the following values:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>IUP_DEFAULT: Proceeds normally with 
    user interaction. In case other return values do not apply, the callback should return this value.</li>
  <li>IUP_CLOSE: Call <b>IupExitLoop</b> after return. Depending on the state of the application it will close all windows 
  and exit the application. Applies only to some actions.</li>
  <li>IUP_IGNORE: Makes the native system ignore that callback action. Applies 
  only to some actions. </li>
  <li>IUP_CONTINUE: Makes the element to 
    ignore the callback and pass the treatment of the execution to the parent element. 
  Applies only to some actions. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Only some callbacks support the last 3 return values. Check each callback 
documentation. When nothing is documented then only IUP_DEFAULT is supported.</p>
<p>An important detail when using callbacks is that they are only called when the user actually executes an action 
  over an element. A callback is not called when the programmer sets a value via
  <b>IupSetAttribute</b>. For 
  instance: when the programmer changes a selected item on a list, no callback is called.</p>
<p>The order of callback calling is system dependent. For instance, the 
RESIZE_CB and the SHOW_CB are called in different order in Win32 and in 
X-Windows 
when the dialog is shown for the first time.</p>
<p>To help the definition of callbacks in C, the header &quot;iupcbs.h&quot; can be used, there are typedefs for all the 
  callbacks.</p>
<h3><a name="mainloop">Main Loop</a></h3>
<p>IUP is an event-oriented interface system, so it will keep a loop &#8220;waiting&#8221; for the user to interact with the 
  application. For this loop to occur, the application must call the 
  <b>IupMainLoop</b> function, which is generally used right before
  <b>IupClose</b>.</p>
<p>When the application is closed by returning IUP_CLOSE in a callback, calling
<b>IupExitLoop</b> or by hiding the last visible dialog, the 
  function <b>IupMainLoop</b> will return.</p>
<p>The <b>IupLoopStep</b> and the <b>IupFlush</b> functions force the processing 
  of incoming events while inside an application callback.</p>
<h3><a name="IupLua">IupLua</a></h3>
<p>Callbacks in Lua have the same names and receive the same parameters as callbacks in C, in the same order. In Lua 
  the callbacks they can either return a value or not, the IupLua binding will automatically return
  IUP_DEFAULT if no value is returned. In Lua callbacks can be 
  Lua functions or strings with Lua code.</p>
<p>The callbacks can also be implemented as methods, using the language&#8217;s resources for object orientation. Thus, the 
  element is implicitly passed as the <b>self</b> parameter.</p>
<p>The following example shows the definition of an action for a button. </p>
<pre>function myButton:action ()
  local aux = self.fgcolor
  self.fgcolor = self.bgcolor
  self.bgcolor = aux
end </pre>
<p>Or you can do</p>
<pre>function myButton_action(self)
  ...
end
myButton.action = myButton_action</pre>
<p>Or also</p>
<pre>myButton.action = function (self)
  ...
end
</pre>
<p>Or, as a string</p>
<pre>myButton.action = &quot;local aux = self.fgcolor; 
                   self.fgcolor = self.bgcolor; 
                   self.bgcolor = aux&quot;
</pre>
<p>Altough some callbacks exists only in specific controls, all the callbacks can be set for all the controls. This is 
  usefull to set a callback for a box, so it will be inherited by all the elements inside that box which implements that 
  callback.</p>
