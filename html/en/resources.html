Resources</h1>
<p>Resources are several auxiliary tools including menus, images, fonts and 
  global names. </p>
<p>Some objects like menus and images, that are not inserted in a dialog 
  children tree, are in fact &quot;associated&quot; with dialogs or controls. 
</p>
<p>Menus can be associated with dialogs only. Images can be associated with 
  labels, buttons, toggles and menu items (this last in Windows only).</p>
<p>Both images and menus to be associated use a global table of names. This 
  exist because of the LED scripts. First you associate the image or menu 
  Ihandle to a name, then you associated the MENU or IMAGE attribute to the 
  respective name. </p>
<p>For example, in C:</p>
<pre>Ihandle* img = IupImage (11, 11, pixmap) ;
IupSetHandle(&quot;myImg&quot;, img);
IupSetAttribute(myButton, &quot;IMAGE&quot;, &quot;myImg&quot;) ;</pre>
<p>or in LED:</p>
<pre>myImg = image[...] (
...
)
myButton = button[IMAGE = myImg](&quot;&quot;)</pre>
<p>or in Lua:</p>
<pre>myImg = iupimage {
...
}
myButton = iupbutton { title = &quot;&quot;, image = myImg }
</pre>
<p>The
	<a href="executables.html">IupView</a> application 
	is capable of converting several image formats into an <strong>IupImage</strong>, and 
	save an <strong>IupImage</strong> as LED, Lua or ICO.</p>
<p>Only dialogs, timers, popup menus and images can be destroyed. Menu bars 
  associated with dialogs are automatically destroyed. </p>
