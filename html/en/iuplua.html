    Lua Binding</h2>
    <h3>
        <a name="iuplua">Overview</a></h3>
   <p>
    All the IUP functions are available in Lua, with a few exceptions. We call it <strong>IUPLua</strong>. To use them the
  general application will do require"iuplua", and require"iupluaxxxx" to all other
    secondary libraries that are needed. The functions and definitions will be available
    under the table &quot;iup&quot; using the following name rules:</p>
    <pre>iupXxx&nbsp; -&gt; iup.Xxx    (for functions)<br />IUP_XXX -&gt; iup.XXX    (for definitions)<br /></pre>
    <p>
        All the
  metatables have the &quot;tostring&quot; metamethod implemented to help 
		debugging.</p>
    <p>
        Also the functions which receive values by reference in C were  modified. Generally, the values of
  parameters that would have their values modified are now returned by the function in the same order.</p>
    <p>
        Notice that, as opposed to C,
  in which enumeration flags are<i> </i>combined with the bitwise operator OR, in Lua the flags are added arithmetically.</p>
    <p>
        In Lua all parameters are checked and a Lua error is emitted when the check fails.</p>
    <p>
        All the objects are NOT garbage collected by the Lua garbage collector, you must
        manually call <strong>iup.Destroy</strong> or elem:<strong>destroy</strong>, if
        you would like to destroy an element.</p>
    <p>
        In Iup additional features were created for the Lua Binding using the metamethods.
        Attributes and callbacks can be set and get in a much more natural way:</p>
    <pre>IupSetAttribute(label, "TITLE", "test")   &gt;&gt;   label.title = "test"             (names are in lower case)<br>title = IupGetAttribute(label, "TITLE")   &gt;&gt;   title = label.title<br><br>IupSetCallback(button, "ACTION", button_action_cb);   &gt;&gt;    function button:action() ... end<br /></pre>
    <p>
        Also the element 
        constructors were changed so you can use tables to initialize their
        parameters and attributes:</p>
    <pre>IupButton("test")         &gt;&gt;    iup.button{title = "test", alignment="acenter"}<br />IupHbox(bt1, bt2, NULL)   &gt;&gt;    iup.hbox{bt1, bt2, margin="10x10"} </pre>
    <p>
        <strong>Lua</strong> was created after <strong>LED</strong>, so that's why <strong>LED</strong>
        exists. Since we have many application
        still using LED, its support will continue in IUP. Today <strong>IupLua</strong> completely replaces the LED functionality and adds much more.>
    </p>
    <p>
        The distribution files include an executable called <b>iuplua51</b>, that you can
        use to test your Lua code. It has support for all the additional controls, for IM,
        CD and OpenGL calls. It is
        <u1:p></u1:p>
        available at the <a href="download.html">Download</a>.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="iupluainit">IupLua Initialization</a></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Lua</strong> 5.1 "require" can be used for all the <strong>IupLua</strong>
        libraries. You can use <b>require</b>"<b>iuplua</b>" and so on, but the LUA_CPATH
        must also contains at least the following:
    </p>
    <pre>"./lib?51.so;"    [in UNIX]

".\\?51.dll;"     [in Windows]
</pre>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">LuaBinaries</a> distribution already
        includes these modifications on the default search path.</p>
    <p>
        The simplest form <b>require</b>"<b>iup</b>" and so on, can not be used because
        there are IUP dynamic libraries with names that will conflict with the names used
        by <b>require</b> during search.</p>
    <p>
        Additionally you can statically link the <strong>IupLua</strong> libraries, but
        you must call the initialization functions manually. The <strong><font face="Courier New">
            iuplua_open</font></strong> function is declared in the header file <strong><font
                face="Courier New">iuplua</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">.</font><font face="Courier New">h</font></strong>,
        see the example below:</p>
    <div align="center">
        <center>
            <table id="AutoNumber1" border="1" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"
                style="border-collapse: collapse">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <pre style="text-align: left">#include &lt;lua.h&gt;
#include &lt;lualib.h&gt;
#include &lt;lauxlib.h&gt;
<b><font color="#ff0000">#include &lt;iuplua.h&gt;</font></b></pre>
                        <pre style="text-align: left">
void main(void)
{
  lua_State *L = lua_open();

  luaopen_string(L);
  luaopen_math(L);
  luaopen_io(L);  

<b><font color="#ff0000">  iuplua_open(L);</font> </b>
  lua_dofile("myprog.lua");
  
  lua_close(L);
}</pre>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </center>
    </div>
    <p>
        When using <strong>Lua</strong> the Iup initialization functions, <strong>IupOpen</strong>,
        <strong>IupControlsOpen</strong> and others, are not necessary.
        The initialization is automatically done inside the respective <strong>IupLua</strong> initialization
        function.</p>
<p>
        To use IUP inside coroutines, define the global attribute 
		&quot;IUPLUA_THREADED&quot;.</p>
    <h3>
        Embedding Lua files in the Application Executable</h3>
    <p>
        The Lua files are dynamically loaded and must be sent together with the application’s
        executable. However, this often becomes an inconvenience. To deal with it, there
        is the <b>LuaC</b> compiler that creates a C module from the Lua contents. For example:</p>
    <pre>luac -o myfile.lo myfile.lua
lua bin2c.lua myfile.lo &gt; myfile.loh</pre>
    <p>
        In C, you can use a define to interchanged the use of .LOH files:</p>
    <pre>#ifdef _DEBUG
  ret_val = iuplua_dofile("myfile.lua");
#else
#include "myfile.loh"
#endif</pre>

<p>This does not work when using LuaJIT. To be able to do that, use Lua files 
directly as strings:</p>
    <pre>lua bin2c.lua myfile.lua &gt; myfile.lh</pre>
    <p>
        In C, simply include the .LH files:</p>
    <pre>#include "myfile.lh"</pre>

using IupLua</a>&quot; that was included in
<a href="http://luaforwindows.luaforge.net/">Lua for Windows</a>. It is now 
available as part of the IUP documentation.</p>
