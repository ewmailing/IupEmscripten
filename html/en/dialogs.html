Dialogs</h1>
<p>In IUP you can create your own dialogs or use one of the 
  predefined dialogs. To create your own dialogs you will have to create all the 
  controls of the dialog before the creation of the dialog. All the controls 
  must be composed in a hierarchical structure so the root will be used as a 
  parameter to the dialog creation.</p>
<p>When a control is created, its parent is not known. After 
  the dialog is created all elements receive a parent. This mechanism is quite 
  different from that of native systems, who first create the dialog and then 
  the element are inserted, using the dialog as a parent. This feature creates 
  some limitations for IUP, usually related to the insertion and removal of 
  controls. </p>
<p>Since the controls are created in a different order from 
  the native system, native controls can only be created after the dialog. This 
  will happen automatically when the application call the
  <b>IupShow</b> function to show the dialog. But we often need the native 
  controls to be created so we can use some other functionality of those before 
  they are visible to the user. For that purpose, the <b>IupMap</b> function was created. It forces IUP to map the controls to 
  their native system controls. The <b>IupShow</b> function 
  internally uses <b>IupMap</b> 
  before showing the dialog on the screen. <b>IupShow</b> can be called many times, but 
  the map process will occur only once.</p>
<p><b>IupShow</b> can 
  be replaced by <b>IupPopup</b>. In this case the result will 
  be a modal dialog and all the other previously shown dialogs will be 
  unavailable to the user. Also the program will interrupt in the function call 
  until the application return IUP_CLOSE or <b>IupExitLoop</b> is called. </p>
<p>All dialogs are automatically destroyed in <strong>IupClose</strong>.</p>
