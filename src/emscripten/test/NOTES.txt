Use the build_all.sh script because the build_link.sh doesn't work. (See below)

- I am still unable to properly build a library. Symbols are getting stripped (see below) and the --js-library modules don't seem to be appearing.


- IUP is oddly one of the few cross-platform projects that doesn't use visibility export annotations for public APIs. Emscripten doesn't support export files, so we need the marker, otherwise all public symbols get stripped when building a library. Emscripten provides the marker EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE which is easily compatible with the Windows __declspec and gcc visibility attributes.



 - To build the library (which doesn't work yet), go to the root of the source tree and do:
emmake make -f Makefile.emscripten


- I'm currently trying to have separate .js files for each widget implementation. This is resulting in needing --js-library flags for each. This doesn't seem to be common. This should be investigated to see what I'm really supposed to be doing, or if I'm even using it right.
