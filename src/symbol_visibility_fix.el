;; so i'm using (insert-file-contents) to copy a C file into a temp
;; buffer.  i'm then trying to traverse the file.  i use
;; (search-forward) to get to the function i need, but my last step is
;; inserting something at the beginning of the function.  i have: int
;; myfunction(int arg1, int arg2).  the point it at the opening (. However, whenever I try to move back a word or move back a char, i can only move back as far as the 'm' in myfunction. whenever i try to go past that whitespace between int and myfunction, emacs freezes.  why is this?
